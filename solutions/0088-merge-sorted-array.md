## Intuition
The first intuition that comes to mind when trying to solve this problem is to use the basic concept of merging two sorted arrays. However, the twist here is that the merging has to be done in-place in the first array, `nums1`, without using any additional space. The requirement to perform the operation in-place hints towards using pointers to keep track of our position in the arrays.

## Approach
Our approach to solving this problem is to use a two-pointer method, where each pointer points to the last element of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. We also initialize a pointer `p` at the end of `nums1` to keep track of where to place the larger element from either `nums1` or `nums2`. 

We then run a while loop to compare the elements at the two pointers, place the larger one at the position pointed by `p` and decrement the pointers accordingly. Once all elements from `nums2` have been checked (i.e., we have placed all elements from `nums2` into `nums1`), the loop terminates. 

In case there are remaining elements in `nums2`, we copy them over to `nums1`. This is done outside the loop, since these elements are guaranteed to be the smallest and should be at the start of `nums1`.

## Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m + n)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively. This is because in the worst case, we will have to visit all the elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.

- Space complexity: The space complexity of the solution is \(O(1)\), which is constant, because we are not using any additional space that scales with input size. The merging is done in-place in the array `nums1`.

## Code
```python
with open('file.py', 'r') as file:
    python_code = file.read()

markdown_content = f"""
```python
{python_code}

This code successfully merges two sorted arrays in-place, ensuring that the resulting `nums1` is a sorted array combining the elements of `nums1` and `nums2`. Happy coding! üéâüë©‚Äçüíª
