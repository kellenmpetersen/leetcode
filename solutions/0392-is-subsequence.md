#ðŸ§µ Unraveling String Subsequences! Crack the Code with the Two-Pointer Technique"

# Intuition
The problem is asking us to determine if one string, `s`, is a subsequence of another string, `t`. My initial thought is that we can solve this problem by iterating through the string `t` and checking if the characters match with the string `s` in order. We keep a pointer to keep track of the current character in `s` that we're looking to match in `t`. If we're able to match all characters in `s` while going through `t`, then `s` is indeed a subsequence of `t`.

# Approach
The approach we take here is the two-pointer technique. We start by initializing a pointer for string `s`. Then we iterate through the string `t` with a for loop. For each character in `t`, if it matches with the current character in `s`, we increment the pointer in `s`. This means we've found a match and we're now looking for the next character in `s`. If we're able to go through all characters in `s`, then `s` is a subsequence of `t`.

# Complexity
- Time complexity:
The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `t`. This is because we're potentially iterating through every character in `t`.

- Space complexity:
The space complexity of the solution is \(O(1)\). This is because we're not using any additional space that scales with the input size. Our space usage is constant regardless of the size of the input.

# Code
```csharp
public class Solution {
    public bool IsSubsequence(string s, string t) {
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < t.Length && j < s.Length; i++) {
            if (t[i] == s[j]) {
                j++;
            }
        }
        return j == s.Length;
    }
}
```
In the code, we implement the approach described above. We initialize a pointer `j` for string `s`, then we iterate through string `t` with a for loop. For each character in `t`, if it matches with the current character in `s`, we increment `j`. This continues until we've either gone through all characters in `t` or found all characters in `s`. At the end, we check if `j` is equal to the length of `s`, which means we've found all characters of `s` in `t` in the correct order.
