# Intuition
At first glance, this problem is about making random choices and observing the outcome. This brings to mind the field of probability. However, since we're also dealing with several states (the amounts of soup A and B), it becomes clear that we need to use dynamic programming.

# Approach
Our approach to solving the 'Soup Servings' problem revolves around a top-down dynamic programming technique, commonly known as memoization. The goal is to calculate the probability of soup A running out first, considering each possible state of soups A and B. Here's a detailed breakdown of our approach:

1. **Initial Consideration:** We begin by addressing a particular property of the problem. When 'n' (the initial quantity of soup in milliliters) is greater than 4800, the probability that soup A will be emptied first approaches 1. This is due to the fact that the operation to serve only soup B is never chosen, while all other operations serve at least some amount of soup A. To optimize our solution, if 'n' is greater than 4800, we return 1.0 immediately and avoid further computation.

2. **Scaling down 'n':** The serving sizes in the problem are in multiples of 25 ml. To reduce the scale of the problem and make our computations more efficient, we divide 'n' by 25 and round up to the nearest integer. This is done using the line `n = (n + 24) // 25`. Now 'n' represents the number of servings of each soup (each serving being 25 ml), rather than the quantity in milliliters.

3. **State Representation:** We then define the state of the system as a pair (i, j), where 'i' denotes the remaining amount of soup A and 'j' indicates the remaining amount of soup B. Each state (i, j) corresponds to a unique scenario with specific remaining quantities of soups A and B.

4. **Memoization Strategy:** To prevent redundant computations, we adopt a memoization strategy. This involves storing the result of each state in a dictionary, named `memo`, after it's computed for the first time. Hence, if we encounter a state that's already been calculated, we can simply retrieve the result from the `memo` dictionary instead of re-computing it.

5. **Recursive Function:** We formulate a recursive function, `dp(i, j)`, to compute the desired probability. This function takes two parameters, 'i' and 'j', representing the remaining quantities of soups A and B, respectively.

    - The function initially checks if the current state (i, j) is present in the `memo` dictionary. If it is, the function returns the stored result, thereby avoiding redundant computation.

    - If the current state is not in `memo`, the function proceeds to calculate the result based on several scenarios:
        - If both soups A and B are empty (i.e., i <= 0 and j <= 0), the function returns 0.5. This is because, according to the problem statement, we count the event of both soups becoming empty simultaneously as half a success.
        - If only soup A is empty (i.e., i <= 0), the function returns 1.0. This aligns with our goal, which is to calculate the probability of soup A emptying first.
        - If only soup B is empty (i.e., j <= 0), the function returns 0.0, since this scenario does not contribute to the probability of soup A becoming empty first.

    - If there are remaining quantities of both soups, the function calculates the probability using the given formula. This formula is derived from the four possible operations for serving the soup, which are equally likely. Each operation serves a different amount of soups A and B, thereby leading to different new states. For instance, the operation "Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B" leads to the new state (i - 4, j), and so on for the other operations. The function calls itself recursively with these new states, averages the returned probabilities, stores this average in `memo`, and then returns it.

Through this approach, we can efficiently compute the desired probability by utilizing memoization to evade redundant calculations and recursion to explore all plausible states and transitions.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) because we need to compute the result for each possible state of soups A and B once, where 'n' is the initial amount of each soup.
- Space complexity: The space complexity is also \(O(n^2)\) because we need to store the result for each possible state in `memo`.

This Python code implements the top-down dynamic programming approach we described. It first handles the case where 'n' is greater than 4800, scales down 'n' by a factor of 25, and initializes the `memo` dictionary. It then defines the recursive function and calls it to calculate and return the desired probability.
